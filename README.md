# Smart Contract Deployments (Hardhat & Foundry)

This repository demonstrates the deployment of Ethereum smart contracts using **both Hardhat and Foundry** across multiple EVM-compatible networks.  
The goal of this project is to showcase familiarity with modern Ethereum developer tooling, multi-network deployment, and contract verification workflows.

- **Hardhat** is used for deployment via Ignition and scripting.
- **Foundry** is used for script-based deployment and on-chain verification.
